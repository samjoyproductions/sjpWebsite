            hi, i'm sam!
        </div>
        <p>
            i am currently a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA, studying Aerospace Engineering and Music. in my spare time, <br>
            i'm also a photographer, musician, and graphic designer, and i'm in the process of learning web development (like with this site here!). <br>
            i work with both digital and 35mm film mediums for my photography, and i focus on capturing the beauty of the small details in life, from <br>
            everyday occurances to once in a lifetime moments. i work for my university in their marketing department, taking photos of campus life <br>
            and trying to capture the true essence of the world around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            i have been a musician for over half my life, specializing in alto saxophone for 12 years, and teaching myself guitar, bass, piano, mandolin, <br>
            and music production along the way. i come from various musical backgrounds, with my own personal interest in jazz, hip-hop, and funk fused <br>
            with the music my parents made when i was young, my mom a classical violinist and my dad playing in rock and indie bands. 
        </p>
        <p>
            i hope that my work brings you new perspectives, discovery, inspiration, and an outlook on life through my eyes and my camera lens.
