                hi, i'm sam!
            </div>

    <div class="paragraphSetup">
        <p>
            i am currently a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA, studying Aerospace Engineering
            and Music. in my spare time, i'm also a photographer, musician, and graphic designer, and i'm in the process
            of learning web development (like with this site here!). i work with both digital and 35mm film mediums for
            my photography, and i focus on capturing the beauty of the small details in life, from everyday occurances
            to once in a lifetime moments. i work for my university
            in their marketing department, taking photos of campus life and trying to capture the true essence of the
            world around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            i have been a musician for over half my life, specializing in alto saxophone for 12 years, and teaching
            myself guitar, bass, piano, mandolin, and music production along the way. i come from various musical
            backgrounds, with my own personal interest
            in jazz, hip-hop, and funk fused with the music my parents made when i was young, my mom a classical
            violinist and my dad playing in rock and
            indie bands. i hope that my work brings you new perspectives, discovery, inspiration, and an outlook on life
            through my eyes and my camera lens.
        </p>
